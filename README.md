This is a program to simulate how drones deliver items to the destination. More details are provided in the PDF file.

PS: This definition is NOT made by me. This is one of a college assignments that I did. I do NOT intend to motivate students to copy and paste this code in their assignment. This code is only for educational reference purpose only. I found this code to be challenging, and hence decided to publish it to help students give a direction and to understand how various data structures can be used in this kind of program. Thank you for understanding.
